    "According to the result of our analysis, downtown Boston (in cluster 1) is the best neighborhood to open an ice cream shop in Boston. It has the greatest number of total venues and is expected to attract many people to visit. This neighborhood with Park, city plaza hall and no ice cream shop. However, the final decision is dependent on the budget of the client to rent the place. According to the budget limitations of the client, we can find other neighborhoods and select the one with the greatest number of venues and a smaller number of ice cream shops around. This clustering can also help our client compare different neighborhoods to make a better decision"

    "Used the information about the neighborhoods of Boston to help my client to select the best location to open an ice cream shop in Boston. Considered number of competitors, demand for ice cream, and budget limitations to find the best location options. This project has some limitations. First, we have limited the location options to the neighborhoods of Boston, however considering more specific locations such as apartmental Areas can improve the accuracy of our decision. Second, we used the median of one bedroom rent price in each neighborhood as an estimate of the rent price. Third, we limited our investigation for the venues within 500 meter of the neighborhoods and changing it can affect the clusters. Over all Good learning and understood better on a activities needs to be performed by a Data scientist."
